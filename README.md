# dsa-practice

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems across multiple platforms like **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, and more. The solutions are implemented in **Rust**, and the problems span different levels of difficulty and topics, including Arrays, Strings, Binary Search, and more.

## Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
- Learn and practice core concepts of **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**.
- Experiment with different problem-solving approaches in Rust.
- Track my progress in DSA over time.
